Here is the funny design document! Here we'll put all the features this software should have :3

NODE BASED OBJECT MANAGEMENT

like godot, all nodes, or as we will call them, layers, will all be in one large tree. Each layer type has it's own properties and functions we can call.

VECTOR BASED DRAWING

All visuals will be drawn from vectors (or imported bitmaps). We will allow importing from SVG files but we wil save them to our own system.

TIMELINE

As most other animation softwares have, we need to add keyframes and timelines. Keyframes will also need easing types between them such as bounce, bezier, and linear.

SOUNDS

Sounds will be their own layer type that have a defined start and end point. That's about it.

SKELETONS

Skeletones would be node trees containing bones. each bone would have a child layer that it is binded to that moving that bone would affect. Each bone would also be able to be moved, resized, and rotated.

That's it for now!

We should also probably add this soon https://github.com/DanWBR/Eto.Forms.SkiaSharp
