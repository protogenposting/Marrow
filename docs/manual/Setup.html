<h1>Setup</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>This Guide will help you set up marrow!</p>

<p>If marrow is already running fine on your pc, you don't need this :3</p>

<h2>Downloading the launcher</h2>

<p>First, you must download the launcher. The launcher can be found <a href = "https://github.com/protogenposting/Marrow-Launcher">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, unzip it and run Marrow Launcher.exe (or just Marrow_Launcher on Linux)</p>

<h2>Debugging Issues</h2>

<p>An error similar to this will likely show up</p>

<img src = "images/launcherError.PNG">

<p>Follow the <a href = "https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads">link</a> given to you and download java 21 or higher.</p>

<p>Once installed, run the program. If any other errors occur follow the instructions given. If it still is not working join the <a href="https://discord.gg/k64EDNHsrj">Marrow Discord</a> and ask one of the devs if they're online OR ask in the forums (wip)</p>

<p>If it all works correctly, running Marrow Launcher will open Marrow!</p>

<h2>Outro</h2>

<p>Now that you have Marrow up and running, refer to the other guides or the Discord for more information on the menus</p>
